## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm an engineering student with a strong interest in building robust systems and intelligent software.
I enjoy working across layers from low-level design and performance-critical code to data-driven and user-facing applications.

⚙️ Deeply interested in C++, Object-Oriented Design, and Low-Level System Architecture

🧠 Actively working on Machine Learning projects, focusing on model performance, generalization, and real-world applicability

🌐 Experienced in building full-stack applications using React and Django, with clean APIs and thoughtful design

📐 Passionate about System Design, writing scalable, maintainable, and interview-ready architectures

🤟🏻 When I ain't coding, I do calisthenics, ukulele and badminton

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy turning complex problems into clean
